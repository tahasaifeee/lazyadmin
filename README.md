# LazyAdmin

A beautiful terminal UI (TUI) for Linux system administration, built with Go, Bubble Tea, and Lip Gloss. Inspired by Lazygit, LazyAdmin provides an intuitive, keyboard-driven interface for managing your Linux system.

- **Services Panel**: Browse and monitor systemd services with their current status
- **Processes Panel**: View running processes sorted by CPU usage with detailed statistics
- **Disk Usage Panel**: Monitor disk usage across all mount points with visual progress bars
- **Beautiful UI**: Styled with Lip Gloss for a modern, colorful terminal experience
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Vim-style keybindings (hjkl) and arrow keys
- **Real-time Updates**: Data refreshes automatically every 2 seconds
